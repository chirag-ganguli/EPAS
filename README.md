# Eye Movement Pattern Based Authentication System (EPAS)

An intelligent **continuous authentication system** leveraging **eye movement patterns** as a biometric Personal Identification Number (PIN). Built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for real-time and secure user authentication.

> ✅ Achieved **95% accuracy** in user identification and reduced **unauthorized access incidents by 30%**.

---

## 👁️ Overview

EPAS introduces an innovative approach to authentication by analyzing **gaze behavior and eye movement patterns** using webcam input. Unlike static PINs or fingerprints, this method enables **continuous verification**, providing an added layer of security for sensitive systems.
